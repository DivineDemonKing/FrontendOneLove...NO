This is simplest CRUD Spring boot + Spring Security + Hibernate project
In this app User can have multiple roles
All CRUD operations are allowed only for Users for admin role
This app does NOT have registration page, only way new users can be registered is by /admin pannel
However, that pannel was not designed to add a user with role/roles, because of that new user will be created with empty role
